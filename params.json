{"name":"Imagemagick","tagline":"Mirror of https://www.imagemagick.org/subversion/ImageMagick","body":"Introduction to ImageMagick\r\n\r\n  ImageMagick®, http://www.imagemagick.org, is a software suite to create,\r\n  edit, and compose bitmap images. It can read, convert and write images in\r\n  a variety of formats (over 100) including DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000,\r\n  PDF, PhotoCD, PNG, Postscript, SVG, and TIFF. Use ImageMagick to scale,\r\n  flip, mirror, rotate, distort, shear and transform images, adjust image\r\n  colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons,\r\n  ellipses and Bézier curves.\r\n  \r\n  The functionality of ImageMagick is typically utilized from the command\r\n  line or you can use the features from programs written in your favorite\r\n  programming language. Choose from these interfaces: G2F (Ada), MagickCore\r\n  (C), MagickWand (C), ChMagick (Ch), ImageMagickObject (COM+), Magick++\r\n  (C++), JMagick (Java), L-Magick (Lisp), NMagick (Neko/haXe), MagickNet\r\n  (.NET), PascalMagick (Pascal), PerlMagick (Perl), MagickWand for PHP\r\n  (PHP), IMagick (PHP), PythonMagick (Python), RMagick (Ruby), or TclMagick\r\n  (Tcl/TK). With a language interface, use ImageMagick to modify or create\r\n  images dynamically and automagically.\r\n  \r\n  ImageMagick is free software delivered as a ready-to-run binary distribution\r\n  or as source code that you may freely use, copy, modify, and distribute\r\n  in both open and proprietary applications. It is distributed under the\r\n  Apache 2.0 license, approved by the OSI and recommended for use by the OSSCC.\r\n  \r\n  The ImageMagick development process ensures a stable API and ABI. Before\r\n  each ImageMagick release, we perform a comprehensive security assessment\r\n  that includes memory and thread error detection to prevent security\r\n  vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nFeatures and Capabilities\r\n  \r\n  Here are just a few examples of what ImageMagick can do:\r\n  \r\n      * Format conversion: convert an image from one format to another (e.g.\r\n        PNG to JPEG).\r\n      * Transform: resize, rotate, crop, flip or trim an image.\r\n      * Transparency: render portions of an image invisible.\r\n      * Draw: add shapes or text to an image.\r\n      * Decorate: add a border or frame to an image.\r\n      * Special effects: blur, sharpen, threshold, or tint an image.\r\n      * Animation: create a GIF animation sequence from a group of images.\r\n      * Text & comments: insert descriptive or artistic text in an image.\r\n      * Image identification: describe the format and attributes of an image.\r\n      * Composite: overlap one image over another.\r\n      * Montage: juxtapose image thumbnails on an image canvas.\r\n      * Generalized pixel distortion: correct for, or induce image distortions\r\n        including perspective.\r\n      * Morphology of shapes: extract features, describe shapes and recognize\r\n        patterns in images.\r\n      * Motion picture support: read and write the common image formats used in\r\n        digital film work.\r\n      * Image calculator: apply a mathematical expression to an image or image\r\n        channels.\r\n      * Discrete Fourier transform: implements the forward and inverse DFT.\r\n      * High dynamic-range images: accurately represent the wide range of\r\n        intensity levels found in real scenes ranging from the brightest direct\r\n        sunlight to the deepest darkest shadows.\r\n      * Encipher or decipher an image: convert ordinary images into\r\n        unintelligible gibberish and back again.\r\n      * Virtual pixel support: convenient access to pixels outside the image\r\n        region.\r\n      * Large image support: read, process, or write mega-, giga-, or\r\n        tera-pixel image sizes.\r\n      * Threads of execution support: ImageMagick is thread safe and most\r\n        internal algorithms are OpenMP-enabled to take advantage of speed-ups\r\n        offered by multicore processor chips.\r\n      * Distributed pixel cache: offload intermediate pixel storage to one or\r\n        more remote servers.\r\n      * Heterogeneous distributed processing: certain algorithms are\r\n        OpenCL-enabled to take advantage of speed-ups offered by executing in\r\n        concert across heterogeneous platforms consisting of CPUs, GPUs, and\r\n        other processors.\r\n      * ImageMagick on the iPhone: convert, edit, or compose images on your\r\n        iPhone.\r\n  \r\n  Examples of ImageMagick Usage, http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/, shows how\r\n  to use ImageMagick from the command-line to accomplish any of these tasks and\r\n  much more. Also, see Fred's ImageMagick Scripts,\r\n  http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/: a plethora of command-line scripts\r\n  that perform geometric transforms, blurs, sharpens, edging, noise removal,\r\n  and color manipulations.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
